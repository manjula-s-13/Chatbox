# Working
This project is designed to send and receive messages between two systems which are connected with their IP address and are connected under same WiFi network.Either of the end-user can request to start the conversation which can be accepted or denied by the other end-user who waits for the connection.The Voice Recognition module will enable the users to speak out their messages which gets converted to text and then can be sent. If any amongst two users wish to stop the conversation then that user can do it by clicking on exit button which immediately informs the other user that the other end-user has left.
